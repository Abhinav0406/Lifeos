# Supabase Environment Variables Check

Please make sure you have these environment variables set in your `.env.local` file:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

To get these values:
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings > API
4. Copy the Project URL and anon public key

Make sure the `.env.local` file is in your project root directory (same level as package.json).
